ftpd
====

FTP Server for 3DS.

Features
--------
- Appears to work well with a variety of clients.
- Also compiles for Linux.
- Supports multiple simultaneous clients. The 3DS itself only appears to support enough sockets to perform 4-5 simultaneous data transfers, so it will help if you limit your FTP client to this many parallel requests.
- Cutting-edge graphics.

Build and install
------------------

You must first install and set up [devkitARM and libctru](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).
