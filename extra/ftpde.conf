## Credential list.

## The entry format is:
##
##    user = "<algorithm>:<salt>$<password hash>"
##
## The only currently supported algorithm is 'sha256'.
##
## Salt can be blank (like the default), but then a rainbow table attack
## can likely recover the password since it is unsalted.
##
## Salt (and Pass hash) should be a hex string. Salted password is the salt hex converted
## to binary and pasted in front of the password, then hashed, excluding the trailing 0.
##
## You can use gen-user.sh if you don't want to do all this manually.
